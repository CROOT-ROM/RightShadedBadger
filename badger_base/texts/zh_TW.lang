##
## 01 # When adding new loc strings, please:
## 02 #   - add them in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts
## 03 #   - use descending hierarchical categories (separated by .) for your key/ID (eg. resources.wood.name)
## 04 #   - when possible, add a contextual comment / note at the end of the line with <TAB>###... For example:
## 05 #       resources.wood.name=木頭	### The name of the Wood resource the player harvests from trees.
## 06 #   - if a loc string is deprecated or unused, you can remove it, or append <TAB>### {Locked} Do-not-translate
## 07 #   - if a loc string is only for internal/debug use, you can append <TAB>### {Locked} Dev-only
## 08 #   - if a loc string is deliberately empty, use a single space; otherwise if it's pending a value, leave nothing after the =, or append <TAB>### (your comment here)
## 09 # Note, trailing spaces will NOT be trimmed; use <TAB>s to separate your comments from the actual localization text.
## 10 # Arguments:
## 11 #	  - %1$s will be replaced by arguments passed contextually by the system.
## 12 #   - %1 will use the first argument, %2 will use the second argument, and so forth
## 13 #   - $s will format the argument as a string. $d will format the argument as a number. Contact UI for more format specifiers.
## 14 # In-Line Text Icons:
## 15 #   -|$[key.value]|will be replaced by an buttonIcon image. For example|$[key.tutorial]|would show an icon of "ESC" on PC.
## 16 #   -|+[key.item.value]|will be replaced by an item image. For example|+[key.item.iron]|would show a block of iron icon.
## 17 #   - Is it possible to combine arguments and in-line icons. For example|+[key.item.%1$s]|if the icon value is dynamically passed in.
## 18 # NOTE: PLEASE ADD NEW ENTRIES ALPHABETICALLY BY KEY NAME BELOW. THANKS!

Text that appears in the match / game log for all team mates when a player pings the structure they are currently trying to build gather orders in Placement Preview mode. The arguments passed in are the name of the player combined with more specific strings for the gather order. For example, it might say "Steve has pinged gather wood". There are many different strings to cover multiple resource inputs. The use of "pinged" refers to the act of sending a short notification to alert other players. The intention here is to help convey what the player is gathering or wants to gather, as players do not have the ability to type to eachother. Placement Preview is the mode the player enters when trying to construct structures.
