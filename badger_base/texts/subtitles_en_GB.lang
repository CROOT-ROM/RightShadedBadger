voiceover.0024_nar_overworld_comingwar_1=Welcome to our world! We would love to introduce you properly but a village needs your help. Please, go to them.
voiceover.0037_nar_overworld_wofcaptured_1=The Great Hog is here…
voiceover.0038_nar_overworld_wofcaptured_2=And they have poisoned the Well. We are losing our connection with the Overworld because of it. We will keep the Well standing as long as we can.
voiceover.0039_nar_overworld_wofcaptured_3=But… what if we can’t?
voiceover.0040_nar_overworld_wofcaptured_4=We must hold onto hope, Knowledge… If you can still hear us… rally the Overworld, save the Well of Fate. We will do what we can to resist the Great Hog but… we need your bravery now more than ever.
voiceover.0060_nar_wofxp_allaymax_1=Improving your musical skills will gather a bigger audience of allays.
voiceover.0061_nar_wofxp_allaymax_2=You'll be a better lute player than me in no time.
voiceover.0063_nar_wofxp_allaymax_4=Better music, more allays!
voiceover.0065_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_2=If you ask me, the best offence is a good offence.
voiceover.0067_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_4=Do you know why it's better to have more Flames of Creation?
voiceover.0069_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_6=Because it's always good to have more friends.
voiceover.0079_nar_wofxp_banner_2=Your inspiration grows. Now more will follow your lead.
voiceover.0080_nar_wofxp_banner_3=Now you have more friends to send the piglins running!
voiceover.0081_nar_wofxp_banner_4=Packing. Send the piglins packing!
voiceover.0082_nar_wofxp_fatebank_1=The more useful resources you can hold onto, the better. This will help.
voiceover.0083_nar_wofxp_fatebank_2=The allays can now save more resources for you.
voiceover.0085_nar_wofxp_fatebank_4=Now you will store more resources for the journey ahead.
voiceover.0086_nar_wofxp_fatebank_5=The battles ahead will demand even more materials from you.
voiceover.0089_nar_poi_purpletiger_3=Regal tigers are the fastest things on four paws. Just what you need to hunt those Piglins down!
voiceover.0091_nar_poi_golem_1=Hmm. It looks like our friend needs a hand.
voiceover.0092_nar_poi_golem_2=A long time ago, this mighty giant helped to shape the Overworld.
voiceover.0099_nar_poi_golem_9=Let me introduce you to the First of Stone.
voiceover.0101_nar_poi_golem_11=The First of Stone moved mountains for us… They will do the same for you.
voiceover.0130_nar_poi_tower_1=Hmm… This may be of use against the Piglins if I can figure out a way to make it moveable.
voiceover.0147_nar_fmv_calltoaction_16=Action, Knowledge, come with me… We must witness this together.
voiceover.0148_nar_fmv_calltoaction_17=Foresight?
voiceover.0150_nar_fmv_calltoaction_19=You're afraid, we all are.
voiceover.0151_nar_fmv_calltoaction_20=No… I am just sad that it has come to this.
voiceover.0153_nar_fmv_calltoaction_22=Shall we begin?
voiceover.0154_nar_fmv_calltoaction_23=Hello, friend.
voiceover.0155_nar_fmv_calltoaction_24=We didn't mean to startle you.
voiceover.0158_nar_fmv_calltoaction_27=Your bravery and creativity inspired us to seek your aid. You see... our world is under attack.
voiceover.0159_nar_fmv_calltoaction_28=It’s being devoured!
voiceover.0160_nar_fmv_calltoaction_29=And it is a danger only you can prevent. Time is of the essence. Will you help us?
voiceover.0161_nar_fmv_calltoaction_30=Thank you. Now step forward, brave Hero, and join us.
voiceover.0162_nar_fmv_calltoaction_31=Hang onto your stomach, this’ll juuust take a second.
voiceover.0165_nar_fmv_epilogue_35=Your courage saved this world, and changed it… forever.
voiceover.0170_nar_fmv_epilogue_40=You have shown us all what is possible if we work together. This Overworld is now capable of a great many things, thanks to you.
voiceover.0171_nar_fmv_epilogue_41=And now, it'll find its own path forward... without us.
voiceover.0172_nar_fmv_epilogue_42=It is time for a new adventure for us. There are endless worlds out there, waiting to be explored.
voiceover.0173_nar_fmv_epilogue_43=We’re not needed here any more, and that’s a good thing.
voiceover.0175_nar_fmv_epilogue_45=Change blows in the wind, friend. Where will it take you?
voiceover.0176_nar_fmv_epilogue_46=Good luck.
voiceover.0177_nar_fmv_epilogue_47=Good luck!
voiceover.0178_nar_fmv_epilogue_48=Good luck.
voiceover.0179_nar_fmv_nightfall_50=First they poison the ground and now the sky?
voiceover.0180_nar_fmv_nightfall_51=Our Hero must see us through the darkness.
voiceover.0181_nar_poi_tower_2=You keep working away at the Piglins and protecting the Villagers, and I'll keep working on this tower.
voiceover.0185_nar_ingamealert_songbook_1=Very nice! This is where all the wonderful melodies you learn will be kept.
voiceover.0186_nar_ingamealert_songbook_2=Now, go ahead and turn the pages.
voiceover.0189_nar_villages_saved_1=You're everything we'd hoped for.
voiceover.0190_nar_villages_saved_2=Indeed. You have already made such a difference here.
voiceover.0191_nar_villages_saved_3=The war's not over but right now is a time for celebration... and thanks. So thank you.
voiceover.0192_nar_pvphq_underattack_1=Uh-oh! Your base is under attack!
voiceover.0193_nar_pvphq_hp10_1=Your base is really close to being destroyed!
voiceover.0194_nar_pvphq_hp25_1=Your base is taking significant damage.
voiceover.0195_nar_pvphq_hp50_1=Your base is in a lot of trouble.
voiceover.0196_nar_pvphq_hp75_1=Your base is taking some damage. Watch yourselves...
voiceover.0214_nar_pvpwofxp_friendlyfatebank_1=You built an allay storage improvement! Now you can stockpile more resources for the fight!
voiceover.0227_nar_pvpmatchover_victory_1=You're the winner! Well done. Well done indeed!
voiceover.0228_nar_pvpmatchover_victory_2=Victory is yours! A well-deserved reward for hard work.
voiceover.0229_nar_pvpmatchover_victory_3=That's what I call a job well done. Congratulations, you won!
voiceover.0230_nar_pvpmatchover_defeat_1=Ooh! Better luck next time!
voiceover.0231_nar_pvpmatchover_defeat_2=Oh, you fought well. Next time, you'll fight better.
voiceover.0232_nar_pvpmatchover_defeat_3=They won this time but they won't be so lucky next time.
voiceover.0233_nar_poi_tower_3=The Allays and I worked out a way for them to move these towers wherever you want. Come back to the Well when you’re ready and I’ll teach you how.
voiceover.0234_nar_poi_tower_4=The Allays can help you take that tower with you if you want. There are more scattered all around the Overworld. Each one will help in their own special way.
voiceover.0235_nar_poi_tower_5=The Allays can help you take that tower with you if you want, and there are even more of them scattered all around the Overworld. Come back to the Well and I’ll teach you how.
voiceover.0236_nar_poi_tower_6=Haha, I can’t wait to see what you do with that!
voiceover.0237_nar_pvp_opening_1=So it begins! You'll need all your wits to gather resources, build defences and defeat the enemy headquarters.
voiceover.0238_nar_pvphq_hp10enemy_1=Your opponents' base is barely standing. Finish it off!
voiceover.0239_nar_pvphq_hp25enemy_1=Your opponents' base won't last much longer.
voiceover.0240_nar_pvphq_hp50enemy_1=Good, good. Your side is doing serious damage to your opponents' base.
voiceover.0241_nar_pvphq_hp75enemy_1=Nice! The opposing base is taking some damage.
voiceover.0267_nar_poi_giantbeetle_4=These brilliant beetles can climb anything. There's nowhere the piglins can hide from you now!
voiceover.0275_nar_poi_giantbird_4=These big beaks glide majestically from any height, which will give you a soaring advantage over piglins down below.
voiceover.0276_nar_poi_carriergolem_1=The Overworld wouldn't be as friendly as it is today without this old helper.
voiceover.0278_nar_poi_carriergolem_3=It looks like they need some help.
voiceover.0285_nar_poi_carriergolem_10=You've awoken the First of Diorite. They're a friend who will make you even more friends.
voiceover.0286_nar_poi_rangedgolem_1=The First of Oak! Without our old friend here planting the seeds, there'd be no forests in the Overworld. 
voiceover.0287_nar_poi_rangedgolem_2=It seems they are in a bit of trouble. Would you be kind enough to help them out?
voiceover.0294_nar_poi_rangedgolem_8=You've already seen how useful your plank golems can be and the First of Oak was their inspiration.
voiceover.0295_nar_poi_shieldgolem_1=Ah… the First of Brick. They shielded us from the elements while the world was being constructed.
voiceover.0296_nar_poi_shieldgolem_2=I remember they had a beautifully carved Emerald Core that… uh-oh, it fell out!
voiceover.0297_nar_poi_shieldgolem_3=Looks like they could do with your help.
voiceover.0303_nar_poi_shieldgolem_8=The First of Brick was our protector in the early days of this world, and now they will do the same for you.
voiceover.0399_nar_pvp_friendlystructures_1=Look out, your defences are under attack!
voiceover.0400_nar_wof_greetingact2_1=Welcome back!
voiceover.0402_nar_wof_greetingact2_3=It is good to see you again.
voiceover.0403_nar_wof_greetingact2_4=The challenge you face is daunting, but the well will always be a place of peace for you.
voiceover.0405_nar_wof_greetingact2_6=You're always welcome here.
voiceover.0407_nar_wof_greetingact2_8=Welcome! Always happy to see a friend return.
voiceover.0408_nar_wof_greetingact2_9=Surviving the wild world, I see!
voiceover.0412_nar_wof_greetingact2_13=Hi there! It's good to see you again.
voiceover.0413_nar_wof_greetingact2_14=This is a place of peace and introspection. Please think of it as your home.
voiceover.0414_nar_wof_leavingact2_1=Good luck out there!
voiceover.0416_nar_wof_leavingact2_3=We will see you safely back soon, friend.
voiceover.0421_nar_wof_leavingact2_8=Stay strong. We'll see you soon.
voiceover.0423_nar_wof_leavingact2_10=Take care of yourself out there, OK?
voiceover.0427_nar_wof_leavingact2_14=See you next time!
voiceover.0454_nar_moballiance_zombiecomplete_1=The flame has been lit.
voiceover.0455_nar_moballiance_zombiecomplete_2=You've earned their trust. The zombies will fight with you wherever, whenever.
voiceover.0458_nar_moballiance_zombieintro_2=This is awful… You have to help them!
voiceover.0460_nar_moballiance_skeletonintro_2=The skeletons are brave but they won't hold out for long. You've got to get in there!
voiceover.0462_nar_moballiance_skeletoncomplete_1=The skeletons recognise you as one of their own.
voiceover.0463_nar_moballiance_skeletoncomplete_2=As long as that flame continues to burn, the skeletons will fight by your side whenever you need them. 
voiceover.0466_nar_moballiance_creeperintro_2=I can't bear to watch this! Please... you've got to help them!
voiceover.0467_nar_moballiance_creepercomplete_3=It’s better to blow up a wall than to bang your head against it.
voiceover.0474_nar_ingamealert_piglincratedrops_1=Everything the piglins take, they stash away for the Horde.
voiceover.0479_nar_ingamealert_treasurechestdrops_1=The allays are eager to help. They'll fill these chests with things that'll aid you in battle.
voiceover.0490_nar_wofxp_allaymax_5=Good choice. The more allays, the better.
voiceover.0495_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_7=You continue to inspire us all, and now more allies will join you in the fight.
voiceover.0497_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_9=Your flames burn brighter and will call more friends to fight by your side.
voiceover.0498_nar_wofxp_spawnermax_10=Now you'll rally more of the world to stand up against the piglins!
voiceover.0502_nar_wofxp_fatebank_6=And now you'll have a place to store them.
voiceover.0504_nar_wofxp_fatebank_8=This Allay storage improvement will keep what you gather safe.
voiceover.0506_nar_wofxp_banner_5=A leader is one who knows the way.
voiceover.0507_nar_wofxp_banner_6=And shows the way.
voiceover.0508_nar_wofxp_banner_7=Now more will fight by your side.
voiceover.0509_nar_wofxp_banner_8=More will now rally to the Banner, but it's your courage that they follow.
voiceover.0527_nar_nis_repercussions_1=What... what happened?
voiceover.0528_nar_nis_repercussions_2=That looks like a piece of a piglin banner. The skeletons' courage has provoked the wrath of the piglins! 
voiceover.0529_nar_nis_repercussions_3=Not just the skeletons. Revenge has come to all of our friends, I am afraid.
voiceover.0531_nar_nis_repercussions_5=Is this the price of their bravery?
voiceover.0583_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_1=One more push and the portal will fall!
voiceover.0584_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_2=The portal is taking some serious damage.
voiceover.0585_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_3=That portal won't last much longer!
voiceover.0586_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_4=Keep pushing, you've almost won!
voiceover.0587_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_5=You have almost done it. Keep fighting!
voiceover.0588_nar_piglinbase_portalhealthgroup2_6=The piglins will fight tusk and hoof to defend that portal. Stay strong!
voiceover.0601_nar_piglinbaseoriginpoint_portalbase_1=I can sense this base holds some... significance to the piglins' strategy. You must destroy it at once.
voiceover.0604_nar_piglinbaseoriginpoint_baseupgrade_1=I sense growing hunger… I believe the piglins will be upgrading this place soon. If you defeat this base, however, you can stop it.
voiceover.0607_nar_piglinbaseoriginpoint_villageattack_1=These piglins are more excitable than usual… They must be preparing for an attack. 
voiceover.0609_nar_piglinbaseoriginpoint_villageattack_3=You mean, attack a village!? Not if our Hero has anything to say about it!
voiceover.0610_nar_invasion_executionphase_1=What was that?
voiceover.0611_nar_invasion_executionphase_2=Something wicked. The piglins are on the move.
voiceover.0616_nar_invasion_villagedamaged1_1=Good news is that the sun is up again.
voiceover.0617_nar_invasion_villagedamaged1_2=But the bad news is that the piglins attacked a village in the night.
voiceover.0618_nar_invasion_villagedamaged1_3=Go to them, see what they need and help them prepare for next time.
voiceover.0631_nar_invasion_villagedestroyed1_1=Usually, the rising sun would fill our hearts with joy.
voiceover.0632_nar_invasion_villagedestroyed1_2=Today, however, we mourn. The piglins destroyed a village last night.
voiceover.0633_nar_invasion_villagedestroyed1_3=We know you did what you could. Some consequences cannot be prevented. But we all do what we can.
voiceover.0653_nar_invasion_piglinbaseupgrade3_1=The Piglins expanded a base.
voiceover.0654_nar_invasion_piglinbaseupgrade3_2=And every time they do, the more their danger grows.
voiceover.0659_nar_overworld_sunrise1_1=I'll never take the sun for granted again.
voiceover.0660_nar_overworld_sunrise1_2=Better check out your map to see what kind of damage the piglins did last night.
voiceover.0662_nar_overworld_sunrise2_2=Everything feels better when the sun is up. The world is brighter and our hearts are lighter.
voiceover.0663_nar_overworld_sunrise2_3=Why don't you check out what's happening in the world?
voiceover.0664_nar_overworld_sunrise3_1=Another day has begun. Perhaps, this is a good time to look at your map to see how the world has changed?
voiceover.0670_nar_overworld_sunset1_1=The sun is setting... That means the piglins will be at their worst. Keep an eye on the villagers!
voiceover.0674_nar_overworld_sunset4_2=The piglins thrive in the darkness and are on the hunt. Beware.
voiceover.0676_nar_overworld_sunset5_2=This is the new Overworld… one that sees dramatic change when the sun sets.
voiceover.0678_nar_invasion_villageunderattack1_1=It's the piglins!
voiceover.0679_nar_invasion_villageunderattack1_2=Hurry! The villagers need your help right now!
voiceover.0682_nar_invasion_villageunderattack3_1=A Village is under attack.
voiceover.0683_nar_invasion_villageunderattack3_2=Which one? Where!?
voiceover.0684_nar_invasion_villageunderattack3_3=Check your map! They're going to need your help!
voiceover.0720_nar_overworld_nightfall_6=You have to find the source of this magic! Find it and stop it!
voiceover.0721_nar_piglinbase_act1base1destroyedreaction_1=This outpost is done. But there are more Piglins out there. There's no time to waste!
voiceover.0725_nar_piglinbase_act1base2destroyedreaction_1=Very good! There is still one more outpost, however.
voiceover.0726_nar_piglinbase_corruptedbeacondestroyed_1=That portal is almost down!
voiceover.0727_nar_piglinbase_corruptedbeacondestroyed_2=Keep fighting. Break their magic!
voiceover.0736_nar_wof_greetingsact2_19=Your commitment brings us such comfort. Welcome back.
voiceover.0737_nar_wof_greetingsact2_20=Look who's back!
voiceover.0739_nar_wof_greetingsact2_22=We are glad to see you again.
voiceover.0741_nar_wof_greetingsact2_24=Hello again.
voiceover.0742_nar_wof_greetingsact2_25=You're working so hard out there. I hope the Well can offer a bit of rest for you.
voiceover.0745_nar_wof_leavingsact2_16=Come back any time.
voiceover.0746_nar_wof_leavingsact2_17=We trust in you. Good luck out there.
voiceover.0749_nar_wof_leavingsact2_20=All visits must come to an end, but it was good to see you.
voiceover.0754_nar_wof_leavingsact2_25=We'll see you soon.
voiceover.0755_nar_wof_leavingsact2_26=See you soon, my friend!
voiceover.0758_nar_wofxp_allaymax_10=You have gathered quite the audience of Allays now. Bravo.
voiceover.0762_nar_wofxp_allaymax_14=The melodies you play will inspire even more allays now!
voiceover.0767_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_1=There are lots of unpleasant things about the piglins but that nasty Netherrack they spread may be the worst.
voiceover.0768_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_2=The Allays are eager to help you pull that poison from the ground.
voiceover.0769_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_3=The Allays can cure our land of this Nether infection, they just need the right inspiration.
voiceover.0770_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_4=And now that inspiration is just a few notes away!
voiceover.0771_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_5=Netherrack may be foul and corrupt, but it's no contest to how determined the allays are to get rid of it.
voiceover.0772_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_6=Perhaps, they will help you see a new beauty to the Overworld.
voiceover.0773_nar_wofxp_unlockclearnetherrack_7=The Allays are ready to start healing the scars of this war.
voiceover.0796_nar_poi_carriergolem_11=You'll see what we mean soon enough. Happy adventures to you both!
voiceover.0797_nar_poi_rangedgolem_9=They will watch over you and all the creatures of the world now that they are on your side.
voiceover.0799_nar_poi_giantgolemproximity_1=Hey, what's that pile of blocks over there? It looks so familiar and yet... upside down?
voiceover.0800_nar_poi_carriergolemproximity_2=It's odd to see bright white Diorite blocks on the surface. Take a look, I think I know what you'll find.
voiceover.0801_nar_poi_rangedgolemproximity_3=Those pigs don't appreciate who's in the bath with them. Pay them a visit and you'll get a surprise.
voiceover.0802_nar_poi_shieldgolemproximity_4=There's an interesting glint at the top of that stone spire. You should investigate.
voiceover.0818_nar_moballiance_reminderhelpzombies_1=You can't rebuild that until the zombies are saved.
voiceover.0819_nar_moballiance_reminderhelpcreepers_1=Help the creepers, then it will be time to rebuild.
voiceover.0820_nar_moballiance_reminderhelpskeletons_1=That has to wait for now. Please stop the piglins first!
voiceover.0860_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_1=Thank you for having the courage to come. I am Foresight.
voiceover.0861_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_2=I hope you’re feeling OK? That kind of trip always upsets my stomach. 
voiceover.0862_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_3=I wish we had met under different circumstances but this world is under attack and we need your help. Foul creatures known as the piglins have emerged from their fiery home and they mean to conquer this peaceful land and all the creatures that live here.
voiceover.0863_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_4=We need your help to make sure that doesn’t happen. But don’t worry, you won’t be alone!
voiceover.0864_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_5=Behold! ...I always wanted to say that. We present to you--
voiceover.0865_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_6=Gifts!
voiceover.0866_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_7=With the right melodies from this lute, the allays will gather your resources, keep them safe for you and build whatever you need.
voiceover.0867_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_8=I'm Action.
voiceover.0868_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_9=Within this case, burn the Flames of Creation. The flames will call upon friends to fight by your side.
voiceover.0869_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_10=These golems helped us shape the Overworld and now they will help you defend it.
voiceover.0870_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_11=And last but not least, this is the Banner of Courage! Raise it high and this world will rise to your aid!
voiceover.0871_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_12=The piglins' hunger is insatiable. They already have a foothold in the Overworld and if they are not stopped, they will devour everything.
voiceover.0872_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_13=We didn’t prepare the creatures of our world for this day. But we believe you can.
voiceover.0873_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_14=That's why we called upon you. If there is any hope… It's you.
voiceover.0882_nar_mobspeep_partone_1=Interesting. The world is waking to the war. Where will this lead?
voiceover.0883_nar_mobspeep_parttwo_2=Our curious creeper is back. And they've brought a friend.
voiceover.0884_nar_mobspeep_parttwo_3=What do you think they’ll do?
voiceover.0885_nar_mobspeep_parttwo_4=We will find out soon enough.
voiceover.0887_nar_overworld_repercussions_1=The children of the Overworld fought by your side to bring back the light, and now their homes are under attack. Go to them and show them they can trust in you!
voiceover.0888_nar_mainstory_vindicators_1=No… others already fight to defend this world. You don’t have to!
voiceover.0890_nar_mainstory_vindicators_3=We cannot stop this. We must respect their choice.
voiceover.0893_nar_mainstory_postvindicators_1=Your actions have inspired the villagers in a way we never anticipated. Please see them through the war.
voiceover.0895_nar_mainstory_unexpectedhelp_2=The dark sky is fuelling the piglins' aggression. What can we do?
voiceover.0898_nar_mainstory_unexpectedhelp_5=Look!
voiceover.0899_nar_mainstory_unexpectedhelp_6=What's happening? How did they learn to fight? 
voiceover.0902_nar_mainstory_unexpectedhelp_9=By watching our Hero.
voiceover.0903_nar_villagersmotivated_parttwo_1=A weapon? What would they do with a... no! Put it back! Put it back!
voiceover.0905_nar_villagersmotivated_parttwo_3=You cannot put back an idea, my friend, and it is clear this war has sparked one.
voiceover.0906_nar_creepers_intro_1=Safe and sound, not a piglin in sight.
voiceover.0907_nar_creepers_intro_2=Let's hope it stays that way.
voiceover.0908_nar_creepers_intro_3=Such power in these creepers but they remain a mystery... even to us. I'm most curious to see how this war affects them.
voiceover.0909_nar_creepers_piglinsattack_1=We lived so long without cruelty in this world, and now all suffer. This must stop.
voiceover.0910_nar_creepers_flameofallegiance_1=Our Hero and the creepers have shown their strength and shared will. This flame will commemorate the bond formed today.
voiceover.0912_nar_skeletons_intro_1=Good… At least the skeletons still have a little peace.
voiceover.0913_nar_skeletons_intro_2=Do you think they'll be OK if the piglins come?

voiceover.0918_nar_skeletons_piglinsattack_4=Do not lose hope, for hope has just arrived.
voiceover.0919_nar_skeletons_flameofallegiance_1=An archer's salute. Now, that is a high honour.
voiceover.0925_nar_zombies_intro_1=Oh, thank goodness! The corpse flower's blooming. That incredible... 'smell' should be enough to keep the piglins away.
voiceover.0926_nar_zombies_intro_2=Piglins don't strike me as the most sensitive of sniffers. They might enjoy this stink even more than the zombies.
voiceover.0927_nar_zombies_piglinsattack_1=The zombies are overrun! They fought bravely to help you but they don't know how to handle such an attack.

voiceover.0954_nar_blasttower_discovery_3=Yeah… I never decided what to do with all that energy.

voiceover.0957_nar_frosttower_discovery_2=Hmmm... I’m trying to remember what I built these for.
voiceover.0958_nar_frosttower_discovery_3=Ha! I don't think that was what I had in mind but it'll do!
voiceover.0959_nar_stuntower_discovery_1=The Villagers once used these towers to call to the allays for assistance. When that bell rings, it makes the sweetest sound you’ll ever hear.
voiceover.0960_nar_stuntower_discovery_2=Yeah… Apparently, we don't share the same taste in music.
voiceover.0961_nar_stuntower_postdiscovery_1=That's an unexpected benefit! I'd take that along if I were you.

voiceover.0969_nar_wofxp_unlockredstone_2=Treat someone with respect and you'll get that respect right back.
voiceover.0970_nar_wofxp_unlockredstone_3=Now all the redstone in the world is yours to gather.
voiceover.0971_nar_wofxp_unlockredstone_4=You are quite the student of music.
voiceover.0972_nar_wofxp_unlockredstone_5=The Allays love your redstone melodies!
voiceover.0973_nar_wofxp_unlockredstone_6=Now all the redstone in the world is yours to gather.

voiceover.0981_nar_onboarding_gathering_1=The Overworld is filled with resources you can gather to help you fight the piglins and that's where the allays come in. Play the right Melody on your lute and they'll gather anything for you.
voiceover.0982_nar_onboarding_gathering_2=Use the lute and play the Melody for the allays to gather wood.
voiceover.0984_nar_onboarding_spawngolems_1=Use the spawner melodies to call the golems you met earlier.

voiceover.0986_nar_onboarding_spawngolems_3=Time is of the essence, friends. We must hurry things along.
voiceover.0987_nar_onboarding_spawngolems_4=Great! Each spawner holds the Flames of Creation that will call upon your allies.
voiceover.0990_nar_onboarding_herolure_1=The golems are new to battle but they'll rally behind you. Use the Banner of Courage to bring your friends over to me.
voiceover.0991_nar_onboarding_herolure_2=Raise the Banner to bring the golems over to me.
voiceover.0992_nar_onboarding_herolure_3=Excellent! 
voiceover.0997_nar_onboarding_herodirect_1=There you go. You can also use the Banner to send your friends in any direction you want. 
voiceover.0998_nar_onboarding_herodirect_2=Send them over to Action.
voiceover.0999_nar_onboarding_herodirect_3=Hello, little friends.
voiceover.1010_nar_invasion_villagetargeted_1=The piglins will attack this village tonight and they are not prepared.
voiceover.1011_nar_invasion_villagetargeted_2=Then our Hero will build strong walls and towers. The Piglins will have their work cut out for them if they come here.
voiceover.1038_nar_onboarding_findpiglins_1=You have a compass and a map. Use them to make sure you're going in the right direction.
voiceover.1040_nar_onboarding_findpiglins_3=Please hurry! The piglins are relentless!
voiceover.1043_nar_onboarding_returnwof_3=After defeating all those outposts, you've collected quite a bit of prismarine. Bring it to me at the Well of Fate and I'll show you how to build something that will be very useful for you.
voiceover.1044_nar_onboarding_returnwof_4=Come on! I can't wait until you get back to the Well to see what Knowledge made for you.
voiceover.1045_nar_onboarding_returnwof_5=You are attuned to the waters of the Well. You can travel here quickly any time you wish.
voiceover.1046_nar_onboarding_returnwof_6=The mossy and grindstone golems are excited to join you but you'll need a special resource to build them. I've written the melody for you. You'll just need to build the right improvement.
voiceover.1049_nar_onboarding_wofxp_3=Don't forget, you can build improvements to your tools.
voiceover.1050_nar_onboarding_wofxp_4=Well done!
voiceover.1053_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_16=We'll be with you every step of the way.
voiceover.1057_nar_onboarding_spawngolems_8=Call them! Call your allies!

voiceover.1067_nar_mobshide_creeper_4=Not hiding... preparing.
voiceover.1068_nar_mobshide_zombie_1=Hmm… We hoped you'd meet the zombies but they're not here. 
voiceover.1069_nar_mobshide_zombie_2=It's this 'night' business. They're spooked like the rest of us.
voiceover.1070_nar_mobshide_zombie_3=The Zombies' homes are empty and their flowers undefended. What could pull them away like that?
voiceover.1072_nar_mobshide_skeleton_1=Usually you'd see a skeleton or two patrolling around here.
voiceover.1073_nar_mobshide_skeleton_2=I bet they're hiding. They're afraid of the dark sky, just like us.
voiceover.1074_nar_mobshide_skeleton_3=There's not a single skeleton around.
voiceover.1075_nar_mobshide_skeleton_4=The dark sky may have emboldened them. Let's see what happens next.

voiceover.1653_nar_moballiance_defended_1=Your friends are free and the flame is lit once more. Well done.
voiceover.1654_nar_moballiance_health_1=The piglins are trying to destroy your allegiance. Protect the flame! Protect your friends!
voiceover.1655_nar_moballiance_health_2=Protect the allegiance tower and you protect your friendship with these brave souls.
voiceover.1656_nar_moballiance_abandonattack_1=Your friends know you will be back to save the day.

voiceover.1659_nar_prenis_findpiglinsvillageoccupied_1=That's the village! Get over there, quickly!
voiceover.1660_nar_nis_findpiglinsvillageoccupied_1=Oh no...
voiceover.1661_nar_nis_repairfountain_1=What a relief… the water flows again.
voiceover.1662_nar_onboarding_firstrepsawn_1=Rest assured that when you're down and out, you have a safe place to fall back to.
voiceover.1664_nar_map_moballiancedamaged_1=Their home was damaged last night. They could do with your help setting up defences.
voiceover.1669_nar_nis_lavacoildefend_1=Oh… this does not look good.
voiceover.1670_nar_nis_lavacoildefend_2=Look, that portal is indestructible! Those lava coils will have to come down first.
voiceover.1675_nar_postnis_lavacoilattack_1=I hate to admit it: quite ingenious, those lava coils. Their heat protects the nearby portal.
voiceover.1678_nar_onboarding_secondvillagesaved_2=And the Villagers want to thank you, too! Go to the Village Chest at the base of the Fountain for a surprise.
voiceover.1679_nar_onboarding_villagechestreminder_1=The villagers want to help in their own way. Open that chest at the fountain to see what they have for you.
voiceover.1680_nar_onboarding_builddefenses_5=The villagers are peaceful but want to help where they can. As gratitude, you can count on their resourcefulness to keep you in the fight.
voiceover.1685_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_17=And I'm Knowledge.
voiceover.1686_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_18=We don't have much time but just enough, I think, to show you a thing or two about these tools.
voiceover.1687_nar_fmv_thecomingwar_19=Thank you again for your courage. We are honoured to have you as an ally.
voiceover.1688_nar_onboarding_piglincamps_3=But this time we have the advantage. If you can shut down the piglin outposts surrounding the village, we might be able to push back this invasion. 
voiceover.1689_nar_onboarding_lapis_1=Lapis dropped by the piglins can be used to fuel your spawners. Collect the lapis to keep your fires burning.

voiceover.1694_nar_onboarding_camp1arrival_1=There are multiple barracks in this outpost. Remove them all or the Piglins will never give up.
voiceover.1695_nar_onboarding_camp2arrival_1=Lava? Here? We clearly underestimated their capacity for corruption.
voiceover.1696_nar_onboarding_camp2arrival_2=Remember the ramps you built with us at the well? They don't only have to go up. Ask the Allays to build you a bridge across that moat.
voiceover.1697_nar_onboarding_camp3arrival_1=I hate to admire their engineering but those Blaze Rod Towers are pretty dangerous and the range is impressive.
voiceover.1698_nar_onboarding_camp4arrival_1=Netherspreaders. The pollution they create makes the air breathable for the piglins.
voiceover.1700_nar_onboarding_camp5arrival_1=Something feels different here. The Piglins threat is… changing. But to what end it is not yet clear to me.
voiceover.1703_nar_onboarding_outpost_1=The Allays can build you a wellhouse to offer a safe place to regroup.
voiceover.1704_nar_onboarding_outpost_2=And for you to travel from, right back into battle! I suggest building these close to where the action is. They'll save you a lot of time.
voiceover.1705_nar_nis_portaldefend_1=The Horde of the Bastion raise great fortresses.
voiceover.1709_nar_nis_portalobstacle_2=The Horde of the Spore are perhaps what antithesise our Overworld the most. They are chaotic, noxious and without reason. 
voiceover.1711_nar_nis_portalobstacle_4=No! Don't go that way!
voiceover.1712_nar_nis_portalobstacle_5=It is going to be particularly unpleasant fighting these piglins…
voiceover.1714_nar_villagersmotivated_partone_1=It's odd to see them so far from home.
voiceover.1715_nar_villagersmotivated_partone_2=Their world is changing and they are curious to learn how.
voiceover.1716_nar_villagersmotivated_partone_3=We saw where that led the creepers…
voiceover.1717_nar_villagersmotivated_partone_4=No. These gentle souls' strength comes from their peace. They will find their way back home.
voiceover.1718_nar_intro_grindstoneandmossy_8=They won’t be as friendly with the piglins, I assure you that.
voiceover.1719_nar_intro_grindstoneandmossy_9=OK, OK... go on now, join your new friends.
voiceover.1720_nar_intro_grindstoneandmossy_10=You too, little one... go on.
voiceover.1721_nar_postnis_lavacoildowndefend_1=You're almost done! The Portal is exposed.

voiceover.1725_nar_invasion_claimarea_1=The piglins' corruption is spreading.
voiceover.1726_nar_invasion_claimarea_2=There are so many of them. But I know you will push them back.
voiceover.1727_nar_map_claimarea_1=The Piglins plan to infect even more of our land. Stop them.
voiceover.1728_nar_village_intro_3=Another village it seems, and… more piglins.
voiceover.1729_nar_village_intro_4=Not again.
voiceover.1730_nar_village_intro_6=Should we go and warn them?
voiceover.1731_nar_onboarding_standalonechest_1=You'll use Flames of Creation to call your friends to battle. Lapis will keep these flames burning bright. Take some from that chest to play a Spawner Melody.
voiceover.1732_nar_onboarding_standalonechest_2=Go on, take some lapis from the chest.
voiceover.1733_nar_onboarding_standalonechest_3=Now, let's light those flames.
voiceover.1734_nar_onboarding_spawngolems_17=Impressive! You're getting the hang of this quickly. That's a mighty little army you've got there.
voiceover.1735_nar_onboarding_combat_8=If you don't take out those barracks, the piglins will never stop.
voiceover.1737_nar_invasion_claimareaplanned_2=The piglins will use this base to claim nearby land. Best to stop them before they do.
voiceover.1738_nar_map_claimarea_1=This area has been infected with Piglin malice.
voiceover.1739_nar_onboarding_gathering_8=Let's do that again. This time, play the Melody for gathering stone.
voiceover.1740_nar_onboarding_gathering_9=When you play the Melody, the allays will gather stone for you. Go on, try it.
voiceover.1741_nar_onboarding_gathering_10=Now you’ve got the resources you need. That’s step one.
voiceover.1742_nar_onboarding_resourcesgranted_1=We've provided you with some starting resources but remember that the allays can gather more for you while you make your way.
voiceover.1743_nar_onboarding_resourcesgranted_2=Busy allays are happy allays.
voiceover.1744_nar_piglinhorde_defendarrival_1=This is the Horde of the Bastion. They build great walls and have strong armour. You must breach both if you are to push them back to the Nether. 
voiceover.1745_nar_piglinhorde_attackarrival_1=The Horde of the Hunt. These piglins are relentless and they never give up the chase.
voiceover.1746_nar_piglinhorde_obstaclearrival_1=The Horde of the Spore makes my blocks crawl. They are a particularly foul breed of Piglin.
voiceover.1750_nar_onboarding_builddefenses_6=Wait a moment before you repair that fountain. The piglins are still nearby and as soon as the fountain is flowing again, they will be back.
voiceover.1751_nar_onboarding_songbook_2=There you go. Now choose the structure to improve your Lute to play the Iron Melody and the Allays will build it for you.
voiceover.1752_nar_onboarding_wofxp_5=And there you have it! Now you'll be able to collect iron in the world and spawn these new friends whenever you need them.
voiceover.1754_nar_piglinhorde_attackbossvillage_1=There's the Beast!
voiceover.1755_nar_piglinhorde_attackbosshealth_1=The Beast may be a hunter but you're no easy prey, are you? 
voiceover.1756_nar_piglinhorde_attackbosshealth_2=The Beast's speed is no match for your bravery! Keep going!
voiceover.1758_nar_piglinhorde_defendbosshealth_1=This mountain of a piglin will crumble soon. Keep fighting!
voiceover.1759_nar_piglinhorde_defendbosshealth_2=Nothing in the Nether could resist this monster – but you can. 
voiceover.1761_nar_piglinhorde_obstaclebosshealth_1=The Devourer is getting desperate. Don't let up!
voiceover.1762_nar_piglinhorde_obstaclebosshealth_2=Defeat this glutton and the Horde will crumble!
voiceover.1766_nar_piglinhorde_insufficientpowerlevel_1=The piglin forces here are quite impressive. Sometimes bravery alone cannot overcome.
voiceover.1767_nar_piglinhorde_insufficientpowerlevel_2=Gather more friends, gather more tools and you'll be ready for this challenge in no time!
voiceover.1769_nar_village_intro_5=As much as it hurts our hearts to see this happen, we must trust that our Hero will see them through it.
voiceover.1770_nar_onboarding_builddefenses_5=They'll keep gathering materials for you while you're out saving the day.
voiceover.1771_nar_onboarding_builddefenses_6=Piglins won't expect those kinds of defences!
voiceover.1772_nar_onboarding_firstskirmish_3=Hear, hear!

voiceover.1779_nar_creepers_act2preattack_1=So many creepers, ready to help.

voiceover.1781_nar_moballiance_skeletonfirstcage_1=That's a few more bows by your side. Now they'll help you free their friends.
voiceover.1782_nar_moballiance_zombiefirstcage_1=The piglins have awoken something dangerous in the zombies. Free the rest and the zombies' strength will join yours.
voiceover.1783_nar_mobshide_zombie_5=Patience. I think we will have our answer soon.
voiceover.1784_nar_mainstory_postvindicators_2=Not all of the villagers have chosen this path but the Warriors who have can be found guarding their villages.

voiceover.1793_nar_poi_golemdiscovered_1=Ahh, you've discovered an old friend of ours. You two will get along nicely but we have to focus on the immediate Piglin threat. We'll teach you a song to wake this Golem up later.
voiceover.1794_nar_poi_golemdiscovered_2=Ahh! You've discovered one of our oldest friends. You two will get along nicely. Come back to the well and we'll teach you a song to wake that Golem up.
voiceover.1795_nar_poi_golemdiscovered_3=Oh! Now that you have a moment, I've added a Melody to your songbook so you can rouse some of our slumbering old friends out in the world.
voiceover.1796_nar_village_newallies_2=They will soon learn it takes more than a weapon to make a warrior.

voiceover.2070_nar_overworld_hordesinvade_5=It is true we have won the battle... but I am afraid the war has just begun.

voiceover.2076_nar_piglinhordes_defensepostbossmad_7=The Unbreakable is furious. The Horde of the Bastion will fight even harder to avoid punishment now.

voiceover.2090_nar_piglinhordes_attackbossdeathreaction_15=You did it…
voiceover.2091_nar_piglinhordes_attackbossdeath_16=That... That was a battle well-fought!
